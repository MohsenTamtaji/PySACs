# PySAC
A python based Machine Lreaning (ML) algorithm for the gibbs free enegy of various intermediates on single atom catalysts (SACs)
************************************************************
Developed by Mohsen Tamtaji (mtamtaji@connect.ust.hk) Under supervision of Professor Tom Luo at HKUST

ML algorithm for the prediction of Gibbss free energy of N2*, H*, OH*, O*, OOH*, COOH*, CO*, and CHO* intermediates for NRR, HER, ORR, and CO2RR

SVR model is trained based on 2104 data in the literature for graphene-based SACs

The ML model is applicable for all the 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals (TM) embedded into nitrogen-doped graphen-based SACs with the structures of TM@N4, TM@N3C1, TM@N2C2, TM@N1C3, TM@C4, TM@C3, and TM@C2. It distinguished the effect of pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen in SAC structre.
